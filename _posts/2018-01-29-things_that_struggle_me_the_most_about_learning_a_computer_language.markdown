Well, here it's me again trying to figure out how to write this blog thing. At the moment I only can see it like a kind of diary... my own programming binnacle.

Today I m going to write about what really struggle my patience about learning to code and may be how I am dealing with it.

1. Unable to understand the explanations.
I know that english is not my native language and some texts or type of words can be difficult to understand for a foreign, but sometimes is not about the words per se, it is more related to  how the examples and explanations are described. I get used to read something and check on in other different sites, it is not like I am doubting about it says, it is about to find who explain better. Sometimes a good example can clarify better than a long text.

2. The examples are not very clear or confused.
This happens to me a lot, specially with languages where you have different ways to execute a command (ex Javascript), I wish there was a master cheatsheet with every possible way to write a command and you are sure that it is going to work in your local computer too.
The only solution I found to this is to test everything a I read, take notes about it and compare different behaviors. 

3. What works in a computer, doesn’t in other.
This is really a headache and make me so many times wasted hours trying to discover why my local machine doesn’t behave like it is written it should. In my workbook I have to columns, one represent how to use Ruby in my terminal (local computer), other for how to use Ruby file execution in the IDE Framework. I still working how to deal with this point.

I wonder if I am the only one…..
