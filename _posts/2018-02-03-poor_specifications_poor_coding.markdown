When I worked as business analyst for SAP ERP I remember I was so meticulous regarding technical specifications so I feel so frustrated when I read some instructions in courses or mails from people asking certain things where I have to guess fifty percent of what they really want.

I am a very visual person, so works for me if only someone draw me an sketch with the essential information about the requirement.  The more easy, simple and pointing to the objective, the more quickly I will be able to code or create an application, workflow or idea. 

Same behavior affects you when you are studying, but what could makes it worst is the fact may be you don’t have enough expertise to know that something is not right and you may fall into the error of learning things in a bad way.

I really think that when you create some content to teach someone something  you need to follow same guides like doing a technical specification.  Some of these premises could be mention like:

* Preciseness: the whole idea should be instantly understood.

* Well-formatted: present the information in a visual way,  mention all the requirements you need with all the data regarding them.  Variables, rules, conditions, screen and other type of objects always jerarquies and order. Relationship between diffent elements should be also metioned.

* Completeness: All important points should be at same level and mention at same place in the document. 

* Use of a Visual Languages which best adaps to the needs. 

This is generally speaking but for project labs I love to have a nice pseudocode to follow or to explain the logic to others.
