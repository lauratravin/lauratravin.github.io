Hello! I decided to show you how I created my ruby final project about kittens, I wil try to make it easy to undertand, not too much technicism and quick reading.

No kitten was harmed during the process and please remenber to adopt or save a kitten no matter her/his breed.

Since I am a visual designer I want to explain my project with images for make it more fun and easier.

The site I scrapped is  [here](http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/breeds) .

The main page contains 50 different breeds, that means I have 51 webpage to scrap at the end.

 I managed my model in this way. Just tree basics classes.

*  The Breed:  Breed is the class who let me to intanciate  breed objects, save their name and web site initally. In a second phase (called method), she allow me to get the  breed characteristics, this attributes, getter and setter are created dinamically.
*  The CLI:  and for last but not least important CLI (Command Line Interface) class,  I think CLI has the hardest work here: deal with the "USER".
