I decided to show you how I made my ruby final project about cats breeds.
No kitten was harmed during the process and please remenber to adopt or save a kitten no matter her/his breed.

Since I am a visual designer I want to explain my project with images for make it more fun and easier.

The site I scrapped is  [here](http://www.vetstreet.com/cats/breeds) .

 I manage my model in this way. Just tree basics classes.
