This is the first thing I write here and I am not very sure where it will be posted. Keep hope in the right place :-)

Well,  I really like to learn a lot of stuffs not only software development. Actually I have a bachellor in Marketing and have studied visual design. 

In 2000 I started to study System Engineering in my country and despite I love the carreer I found a lot of desmotivation coming from professors, unversity administration and old study techniques.

After that I was lucky to enter to a SAP Bootcamp and learnt ABAP and functional analysis stuffs. Thanks that I have worked in interesting project and traveled a lot around the world.

I love SAP but I wanted to move to something more open source, web and related to design... so HTML, CSS, JavaScript Welcome! 

 I love to study and a cats are less curious than me. I think I will be learning new thing until the end of my days.
