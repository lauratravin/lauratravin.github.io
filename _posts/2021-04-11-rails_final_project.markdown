Project is about?
The project is an web application about races and the runner registration for a sport organization, in which a user (Admin) can create and manage races, user, registrations. The users (runners), can find the available races offered during the calendar year and create a registration. 
User also can set a miles goal that will be automatically updated as soon as the race's date is expired. The admin of the system should load the pace result of each runner, it should be done automatically but for the purpose of the project it is done manually.

At the moment it does not have the logic to knwo if the runner ran or not, but it is something that can be added in the future.
